# SPARQL
Material on SPARQL.

## SPARQL queries
The directory SPARQLqueries contains queries useful to carry out common or important tasks on ontologies.

## Development
I plan to add SPARQL exercises to complement the useful guides on learning SPARQL that already exists (e.g. Bob DuCharme's Learning SPARQL and chapter 6 of Dean Allemang's et al. Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist).
